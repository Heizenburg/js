## Guidelines

- All functions shuld have unit test cases
- each problem/issue and it's test cases should contain in on folder with name in format ( functionName-issuenumber )
  example isPrime-10
- Each individual should work on a branch and crete a pull request to master
- Assign pull request to some one in your team and and me.
  ( so there will be two reviewers )

## Running test cases

- In project root directrory open terminal or cmd and type `npm test`
- Your spec file should end with .spec.js
